# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project. Contributions are welcome and appreciated.

This guide explains how to set up the project, make changes, and submit contributions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-name>
```

### 2. Install PHP dependencies

This project uses Laravel. Install PHP dependencies with Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Install frontend dependencies

If the project uses frontend assets, install JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure your environment

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate an application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Update your `.env` file with your local configuration.

This project uses PostgreSQL. Make sure your local database settings are configured correctly:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=<database-name>
DB_USERNAME=<database-user>
DB_PASSWORD=<database-password>
```

Configure VATSIM OAuth test credentials:
See the wiki at `https://vatsim.dev/services/connect/` in how to do this. Common issues with authentication are usually related to the redirect URL not exactly matching the URL in your browser.

### Other Environment Secrets

Some features may require specific environment secrets or service credentials that are not included in the repository.

If you need access to specific environment secrets, contact:

```text
zjx-wm@vatusa.net
```

Do not commit secrets, credentials, tokens, API keys, or private configuration values to the repository.

### 5. Run database migrations

After configuring PostgreSQL, run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

And seed the database, which will seed the permissions information and queue a roster sync job (if the sync job fails, make sure you have access to the VATUSA API and have the base URL set in your .env).
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### 6. Start the development server
It is recommended to use `composer run dev` instead of `php artisan serve` as it will run the queue worker and scheduler concurrently, as well as bundle assets required by npm.
```bash
composer run dev
```

## Making Changes

Please keep changes focused and easy to review.

Before opening a pull request:

* Make sure your code follows the existing Laravel conventions.
* Add or update tests when appropriate.
* Update documentation if your change affects setup, usage, or behavior.
* Avoid unrelated formatting or refactoring in the same pull request.
* Do not commit generated files, local environment files, or dependency directories unless specifically required.

## Testing

Run the test suite before submitting your changes:

```bash
php artisan test
```

You can also run Pest directly (`./vendor/bin/pest`) or via the Composer script, which clears cached config first:

```bash
composer test
```

### Conventions

- Tests use [Pest](https://pestphp.com/). The base `Tests\TestCase` and the `RefreshDatabase` trait are bound to the **Feature** suite in `tests/Pest.php`, so each Feature test runs against a fresh, migrated database.
- Model data is created with factories and `spatie/laravel-permission` helpers, e.g. `User::factory()->create()` and `$user->assignRole('staff')`. Only `UserFactory` exists today — if you test a model that has no factory, add one under `database/factories/`.
- Authorization tests seed permissions first with `$this->seed(PermissionSeeder::class)` before assigning roles.
- Custom expectations live in `tests/Pest.php` (e.g. `toRunInLessThan(...)` for performance-sensitive assertions).

### Database engine caveat

There is a known split between local and CI test databases:

- **Locally**, `phpunit.xml` sets `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql` with database `zjx_test`, so `php artisan test` runs against PostgreSQL. Create that database (or adjust `phpunit.xml`) before running tests.
- **In CI**, tests run against SQLite inside Docker (`tests/docker-compose.yml` overrides the connection). The container's environment variable takes precedence over `phpunit.xml`.

Because the two environments use different engines, prefer database-agnostic queries and be cautious with engine-specific SQL. This inconsistency is tracked in [`docs/discrepancies.md`](docs/discrepancies.md).

## Database Changes

If your contribution changes the database schema:

* Create a Laravel migration.
* Avoid modifying existing migrations unless specifically requested.
* Include any needed model, factory, seeder, or test updates.
* Make sure migrations run cleanly on a fresh PostgreSQL database.

## Commit Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages.

Good examples:

```text
Add user profile validation
Fix PostgreSQL migration issue
Update Laravel queue configuration
```

Avoid vague messages such as:

```text
fix stuff
updates
changes
```

## Pull Requests

When opening a pull request, please include:

```markdown
## Summary

Briefly describe what changed.

## Why

Explain why this change is needed.

## Testing

Describe how you tested the change.
```
PR Authors are responsible for resolving merge conflicts. If something is ambiguous, please do not commit any changes and consult a PR reviewer with what was ambiguous for clarification.

For user-facing changes, include screenshots or examples when helpful.

## Code Style

Follow the style and conventions already used in the project.

For Laravel code:

* Use Laravel conventions for controllers, models, requests, policies, jobs, events, listeners, and services.
* Prefer clear, readable code over overly clever solutions.
* Keep business logic out of routes when possible.
* Use migrations for database schema changes.
* Use environment variables for configuration values.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include:

* A clear description of the problem.
* Steps to reproduce the issue.
* What you expected to happen.
* What actually happened.
* Your environment, such as operating system, PHP version, PostgreSQL version, Node version, and browser.
* Screenshots, logs, or error messages when helpful.

## Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome.

Please describe:

* The problem the feature would solve.
* The proposed solution.
* Any alternatives you considered.
* Whether you are willing to help implement it.

Please create an issue for any relevant features and discussion.

## Security Issues

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report security issues privately to:

```text
zjx-wm@vatusa.net
```

Please see SECURITY.md for more information.
